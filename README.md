# Frootle

Just a place to play around and test my experimental stuff. Front end using react. Basically for accessing the backend Shongle.

Currently, has:
 - short reporting
   - stuff for checking short data retrieved from sfc
   - (to deprecate) ui for manually uploading short data
   - (experimental lol) ui for fixing mis-parented short data to their correct parent
 - portfolio diary
   - transactions tracking
   - expenditure/profit tracking
   - diary for thought tracking
   - visualising holdings changing over time
